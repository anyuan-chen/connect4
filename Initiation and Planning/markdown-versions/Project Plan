# Project Plan

### Risk Management
We recognize the risk that may be posed by having uncoordinated testing environments and different versions of our code and seek to fix this with the usage of version control and proper communication.

Version control will be done using Github. Before either developer makes any edits to the program, they will check that their testing environment uses only the most updated files, identical to those on the shared repository. After editing or adding files, developers will commit all of their changes immediately to the repository.

To cover any issues that may come up, Discord will be used  as the primary method of communication for this project. This software was chosen due to its ubiquity and ease of use for a team of two users. Meetings will be held twice a week to discuss the state of the project and any changes that need to happen.

Change management will be introduced with both members of the development team needing to communicate before implementing any change of scope through Discord.
